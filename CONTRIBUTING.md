## Submitting a Pull Request

Use the GitHub UI to submit a [new pull request][pr] against upstream/master.

Ideal code has the following, anything less will slow down your PR acceptance:
* Write tests
* Make sure the whole test suite is passing
* Keep your PR small, with a single focus
* Maintain a clean commit history
* Use a style consistent with the rest of the codebase
* Before submitting, [rebase your work][rebase] on the current master branch

From here, your pull request will be reviewed, updated where necessary and then merged to master.
